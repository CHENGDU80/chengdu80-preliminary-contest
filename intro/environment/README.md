# Competition Environment

Because of the global impact of Covid-19, we have chosen to conduct this year's chengdu80 tournament online. To do so, we provided a cloud-based competition environment where teams around the world could choose the nearest available area to access computing power and release prototypes.

To introduce the completion of the project, the following informations are provided:
